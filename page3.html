            “Try this! Press, Twist, then load!” Someone says.
            “No no, it's Press, Load then Twist! I see em do it all the time!” Another voice corrects.
            “Ok peanut gallery, just let Delores do it.” Will says.

            “Alright Dee, now it's your turn!” Will states.
            “Looks like I’ll need your help now Will!” Delores responds.
            “Let’s see here, what was that order for you?” He asks himself quietly.
            “Press, Press, Turn, Empty Lint, Press, Load, Press?” The peanut gallery says.
            “There's way too many presses, and we need to load the clothes first.” Will states.
            “Oh that makes sense, ok load the clothes first, then do a bunch of other things!” The peanut gallery chuckles.”

            “Like that would ever happen!” Will laughs.
            “Hey, we would get it eventually!” The peanut gallery remarks.
