            After the player completes the minigame above, another table comes on screen.
            “Oh this one reminds me of Dave! Dave, are you there?” Larua calls out to the Kitchen.
            “Right here!” Dave responds.
            “Shhh” The stove hushs them, “We don’t want to give Dave any hints!”
            [Player perspective shifts to Dave the kitchen table.]
            “I’ll find it eventually!” Dave laughs, “Don’t be so harsh Steve.”
            “I’ll be the one giving the hints! And you only get 3!” Steve remarks.
            “Ok ok. Hmm. What was the item again?” Dave asks.
            “I spy with my little eye, a circle!”
            “That’s right, ok let’s see…”
            <br><br>
            [Mini game of I spy in the kitchen. Going through different items in the kitchen. First one being a clock on the wall. More hints are added depending on the items, and each item has 3 additional hints to be given.]
                [IF ITEM FOUND]
                “Nice job! Ok next item…” Steve will say.
                [IF ITEM WRONG]
                “Try again! Remember its [ENTER ITEMS FIRST HINT]”
            <br><br>
            [After finding about 5 items, the refrigerator chimes in]
            “Well I’ll be, You got quite the sharp eye Dave!” THe refrigerator says.
            “Thanks Frida, why don’t you give me some items to find too!” Dave wonders.
            “Sure thing! Here, let me open up the doors and theres a lot more items to find!” Frida states.
            “Ok!” Dave says.
            After frida opens the doors, “Ok, can you find the milk?”
            <br><br>
            [Mini game of finding specific items by name, about 5 items will need to be found to continue. She will only give 1 hint each time.]
                [IF ITEM FOUND]
                “That’s it! Now can you find…” Frida will say.
                [IF ITEM WRONG ONCE]
                “Try again! Remember its [ENTER ITEMS FIRST HINT]”
                [IF ITEM WRONG TWICE]
                “It's right there!” Steve will butt in. “Not always easy to find everything, try another item!”
            <br><br>
            [After minigame is completed]
            “Thanks for all your help Steve and Frida!” Dave politely says.
            “Your welcome!” They exclaim together.
            Suddenly, from the corner of the room, you hear, “This blasted thing!”
            “Who was that?” Dave asks.
            “Sounds like Will needs some help in the back room.” Frida responds.
