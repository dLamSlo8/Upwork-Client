            [Perspective jumps outside to George the grill.]
            “Almost got it Harry! Give it a good pull this time!” George cheers on.
            “Pass me some lemonade dear.” Alexa, one of the lawn chairs asks.
            “Of course!” Rose, the other lawn chair obliges as she hands her a lemonade. Both of the lawn chairs have art deco style sunglasses, each with different colored rims. They also both have different patterns on their chairs to help keep them separate and more recognizable from each other.
            Harrys engine roars to life, a neighbours light turns on in reaction.
            “Uh oh! I better go fast!” Harry remarks.
            “You got this!” George says.
            [Perspective shifts to Harry, minigame starts cutting the grass. Player needs to cut all of the grass in the fastest time possible. To do this, they will also need to kind of know the most efficient way to cut the grass. To increase replayability here, you can change the shape of the yard each time to make it more randomized. A timer counts down from 2 minutes, once the timer runs out, the people in the house will wake up and come outside to see what's happening. At that point Harry will need to turn off and the minigame resets. The person who came outside will push Harry back to the start.]
            <br><br>
            [IF COMPLETED IN TIME]
            “Just in time!” Harry pridefully says.
            “I knew you could do it!” George cheers.
            “Well done! Alex says.
            “I never had any doubt” Rose remarks.
            [IF TIME RUNS OUT]
            “Shoot! Lets try again!” Harry says.
            “Don’t worry man, you got this!” George will say.
            <br><br>
            “Is that the sun coming up?” Harry asks aloud.
            “Well I’ll be, it’s already dawn.” Rose says as she lifts her sunglasses to see the sun better.
            “I’m ready for a day of grillin’ and chillin’” George playfully says.
            “I hope they cook burgers again, they smell so good!” Alexa hopes.
            “Burgers, and steaks!” Roses adds, “I could eat both right now!”
            They all give a good chuckle as the sun rises and the next day comes on. The family starts to grill and enjoy the day with all the furniture.
