            <div class="book-content">
                <p>
                Family all hanging out in the family room. The sun is shining through the windows, the TV has a funny movie on, everyone burst out in laughter from a scene just played on the TV.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                All the family members are heard saying “Goodnight!” to each other. Lights turn off in the peripheral view. The couch remains in view in a blue hue lit by the moon. A cartoonish eyes and mouth appear on the couches central back cushion, 
                “Ok guys they’re gone for the night!”.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                The couch then cartoonishly bends its couch armrest to turn on a nearby soft standing light. This reveals a loveseat nearby with a floral pattern and feminine cartoonish eyes and lips on its back cushion with a Monroe mole where her chin would be.</p>
            
                <p>
                “Vinny you can come out now.” She says while shifting to get a better view of the light.
                Vinny can be heard snoring.
                “Vinny!” She exclaims, “the show is about to start!”
                Vinny sniffles waking up, revealing a rocking chair with a much older complexion with droopy eyes and a beard attached to the cartoon mouth on the back of the rocking chair.
                “Shh, Oh!” He reacts to the loveseats noise. “I’m awake, I'm awake! Keep it down please Laura!”
                Laura chuckles to herself, “Opsie!”.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                Ok now I just.. Need… to… reach…” The couch stretches their couch armrest cartoonishly to
                read for the remote on the coffee table in front of them.
                “You’ve almost got it Joe!” Laura sarcastically retorts.
                “I’ll.. get… it..” Joe pushing as far as he can. “Gahh!” He exhaustedly spouts.
                “Let me help you with that.” Laurel grins, as she easily grabs the remote and turns on the TV to an antique furniture show.
                “I loved seeing harold last week, they fixed up all six of his cushions!” Vinny excitedly brings up.
                “You’ll see me in those bright lights one day, you’ll see!” Vinny laughs to himself.
                Joe and Laura roll their eyes. 
                “You guys know so many people, I was just created a month ago.” Joe admits. “You’ll have to help me identify who’s who on the show, ok?”
                “Of course dear!” Laurel insists, “Let's catch you up on your counting eh?”
                The auctioneer on the TV brings out a dinner table with 1 central leg.
                “There you go Joe, how many legs are on that table?”
